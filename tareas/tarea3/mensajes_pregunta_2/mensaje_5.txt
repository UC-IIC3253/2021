Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.

                                     GITTES
                         No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get
                         'em out of here!

               He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the
               sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it
               but someone else has it.

               EVELYN

               Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of
               herself.

               GITTES

               Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.

                                     EVELYN
                         No, don't help him. Don't do anything.

               Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds
               the revolver on him.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's gone. It's no good.

                                     CROSS
                         Where?

                                     GITTES
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Let me handle that.

                                     EVELYN
                              (to Gittes)
                         I'm all right.

                                     GITTES
                              (she's not)
                         Sure, but I'd like to handle it.

               Evelyn backs up as her father takes a step toward her.

                                     CROSS
                         You're going to have to kill me,
                         Evelyn. Either that or tell me where
                         she is.

               Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the
               pistol.

                                     CROSS
                         How many years have I got?... she's
                         mine too.

                                     EVELYN
                         She's never going to know that.

               There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes
               grabs Cross.

               Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees
               them.

                                     GITTES
                         Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.
                              (to Walsh)
                         Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to
                         bring the police department with
                         you.

                                     WALSH
                         Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all
                         over the place. You oughta know
                         better.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Walsh, meaning
                              Cross)
                         Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart,
                         will you?
                              (moving to Evelyn)
                         Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in
                         Pedro, near the Starkist cannery.
                         It's the Evening Star. He'll be
                         waiting. I'll take care of this.

               She looks to Gittes. He looks at her. She turns and he looks
               at her.

               She turns and Escobar is standing between her and it.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run
                         around like that.

                                     GITTES
                         Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know
                         what's going on. Let her go. I'll
                         explain it later.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious
                         offense pointing that at an officer
                         of the law. It's a felony.

                                     GITTES
                         Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (starting toward her)
                         I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.

                                     GITTES
                         Lou, she will kill you. Let her go
                         for now. You don't know.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         Gittes, stay outta this.

               Escobar continues to move toward her. Gittes grabs him.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Evelyn)
                         Now take off.

               Evelyn gets in the car. She starts it. Gittes lets Escobar
               go.

                                     ESCOBAR
                         I'll just have her followed. She's
                         not going anywhere.

               There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the
               block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his
               double-parked car.

               Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street.
               It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a
               halt.

               Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out,
               inert.

               Blood is pouring from her right eye.

                                     GITTES
                              (yelling)
                         No!

               He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up. Cross
               himself elbows through.

                                     GITTES
                         Where is he? I'll kill him, I'll
                         kill the son of a bitch.

               Several officers contain Gittes.

                                     GITTES
                              (to Escobar)
                         Who is he, get his name? I'll kill
                         him.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (badly shaken)
                         Take it easy, take it easy, it was
                         an accident.

                                     GITTES
                         An accident?

               Gittes looks down. What he sees horrifies him. Cross is on
               the ground, holding Evelyn's body, crying.

                                     GITTES
                         Get him away from her. He's
                         responsible for everything. Get him
                         away from her!

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (stunned)
                         Jake, you're very disturbed. You're
                         crazy. That's her father.

               Walsh and Duffy elbow through the crowd.

                                     ESCOBAR
                              (to them)
                         You wanna do your partner the biggest
                         favor of his life? Take him home.
                         Just get him the hell out of here!

               Duffy bear hugs the protesting Gittes, along with Walsh,
               literally dragging him away from the scene, with Gittes trying
               to shake free.

               Through the crowd noises, Walsh can be heard saying, "Forget
               it, Jake. It's Chinatown."
